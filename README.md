# House_Price_Analysis
A quick analysis of the houses prices in Seattle and Boston
The project tries to compare the prices of houses in Boston and Seattle based on the property_type and room_type. Data analysis is one of the primary tasks of Data Science and in this notebook I try to analyze the AirBnB Open Data for Seattle and Boston

## Motivation
 I tried answering the following questions based on the data from AirBnB:
  - Which of the property_type is costlier ?
  - Which of the room_type is costlier ?
  - Which area is costlier - Seattle / Boston ?
  
## Dependencies
The project is developed using Python 3 and the following packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib

## File Description
  - `Seattle vs Boston AirBnB Price Analysis.ipynb`: Notebook containing the data analysis.
  - seattle_listings.csv: Data file containing the house details of Seattle
  - boston_listings.csv: Data file containing the house details of Boston
